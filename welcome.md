# Data Structure Tutorials

Welcome! These tutorials cover three different data structures. They are meant to give a basic introduction to each data structure type. At the end of each tutorial is an example of how to create and implement the data structure in Python, as well as a task. At the end of each task are test cases, as well as the expected results.
